Placeholder and tutorial

The plan of setting up a github is to allow me to add Matlab, R and Arduino scripts that I've written for my own work that have more general applications for Neuro research. 

That's the best case scenario. Worst case*, I have just given my procrastination an extra outlet.

*Actually the best case.
